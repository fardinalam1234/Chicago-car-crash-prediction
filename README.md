We will be training the model to make predictions based on correlations between many different conditions on when it is safe to drive/how likely an accident will occur. Examples would include weather conditions, time of day, length of trip etc. We will be using the dataset of Chicago car crashes from 2013-2023: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathaniellybrand/chicago-car-crash-dataset/data
